Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 
```{r}

```

```{r}
pitches
```
```{r}
game1 = filter(pitches, gameId == "dc42dfe7-d6dd-4831-a9ad-c1dcfc8f62af") %>%
  arrange(inningNumber, desc(inningHalf), inningHalfEventSequenceNumber, hitterPitchCount)
```
